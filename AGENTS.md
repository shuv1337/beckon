# Beckon — notes for coding agents

Read this before installing or modifying Beckon on a user's machine.

## What it is

A voice agent for Omarchy users; it also runs on other Hyprland-based setups with small adjustments. `live.py` holds a Gemini Live API
session (audio both ways over one WebSocket) and executes the tools in
`tools.py` against Hyprland. `ui.py` + `ui.html` is a local control panel on
`127.0.0.1:8777`. `tour.py` is a self-narrating demo; `narrate.py` generates
its audio with the Gemini TTS model.

Independent project built for Omarchy users — not affiliated with Omarchy, Hyprland, or Google.

## Install on Omarchy (verified steps)

1. Dependencies. Everything but the SDK is in the official repos.
   ```
   sudo pacman -S --needed python-websockets python-sounddevice wtype grim wl-clipboard ydotool libnotify
   yay -S --needed python-google-genai
   ```
   Check: `python3 -c "import websockets, sounddevice, google.genai"` prints nothing.
2. `git clone https://github.com/Steven-Tibbs/beckon.git && cd beckon && ./install.sh`
   Check: `command -v beckon` resolves to `~/.local/bin/beckon`.
3. API key. Never handle it yourself — tell the user to run `beckon ui` and
   paste it, or to write it themselves:
   `install -m 600 /dev/null ~/.config/beckon/api_key` then edit the file.
   Check: `wc -c < ~/.config/beckon/api_key` is roughly 39; keys start `AIza`.
4. Keybinding. Append to `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`:
   ```lua
   o.bind("F8", "Beckon", "python3 " .. os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.local/share/beckon/live.py")
   ```
   Then `hyprctl reload` and confirm `hyprctl configerrors` is empty.
   Check F8 is free first: `omarchy menu keybindings --print | grep '^F8'`.
5. Mouse clicks (optional). `ydotool` needs a daemon with `/dev/uinput`
   access; see the README's *Mouse clicks* section for the system unit.
   Check: `ls -l /tmp/.ydotool_socket` is owned by the user, mode `srw-------`.
6. Smoke test: `beckon` starts a session and shows a "Listening" notification.
   Ask it *"how many windows do I have open?"* — it should call `list_windows`
   and answer aloud. `beckon ui` shows the tool count and an empty history.

## How the pieces fit

- **`common.py`** is the one leaf module: paths, `settings()`/`setting()`,
  `api_key()`, `write_private()` (0600 + atomic), `generate_content()` (key in
  the `x-goog-api-key` header, never the URL), `ydo()`, `browser()`, `notify()`.
  Every model name lives in `common.DEFAULTS` and can be overridden from
  `settings.json`. Don't re-copy any of these into another file.
- **Tool schema** is generated from `tools.py` function signatures and
  docstrings. To add a tool: write a function, list it in `TOOLS` at the
  bottom of the file. Docstrings are what the model reads — keep them exact.
  Parameter types come from the default value: `False` → BOOLEAN, `0` →
  INTEGER, `""` → STRING. `live.coerce_args` also casts what the model sends,
  so a string `"false"` for `force=` can never read as True. Tool calls run
  in a worker thread (`live.run_tools`), sequentially, so a slow screen read
  never freezes the mic or speaker.
- **Shell tools** live in `~/.config/beckon/custom_tools.json` and are loaded
  by `load_custom_tools()` at import. `{arg}` placeholders are shell-quoted.
- **Hyprland calls** use the Lua dispatcher API via `hyprctl dispatch 'hl.dsp…'`.
  Verified shapes: `hl.dsp.focus({ workspace = "2" })`,
  `hl.dsp.window.move({ workspace = "2", follow = false })`,
  `hl.dsp.window.resize({ x = 50, y = 0, relative = true })`,
  `hl.dsp.workspace.move({ monitor = "r" })`,
  `hl.dsp.cursor.move({ x = 100, y = 100, absolute = true })`.
  Classic `hyprctl dispatch movewindow l` syntax does NOT work here.
- **Coordinates** for `cursor.move` are Hyprland's logical layout coordinates —
  the same ones `hyprctl clients -j` reports in `at`/`size`. Not physical pixels.
- **Mute file.** While `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/beckon/mute` exists, `live.py` stops
  sending mic audio and drops the model's audio output. The tour creates it so
  the model can't hear its own narration through the speakers and answer it.
- **Half-duplex gating.** `live.py` stops sending mic audio while model audio
  is queued or playing, plus a 0.4s tail (`SPEAK_TAIL`). Without this, the
  model's voice re-enters through the laptop mic and the Live API's VAD treats
  it as an interruption -- it cuts itself off mid-sentence. `BECKON_BARGE_IN=1`
  disables the gate for headphone users. Start-of-speech VAD sensitivity is
  also set LOW to ignore faint bleed.
- **Memory** is `memory.py`, backed by `~/.config/beckon/memory.json`. Rendered
  into the system prompt at session start (`memory.render()`), capped at 40
  preferences / 30 notes / 200 chars. Tools: `remember`, `note`, `recall`,
  `forget`. The prompt tells the model to ask once for a generic target
  (email, music) and then `remember()` it. Don't add unbounded memory.
- **Edge glow** is `glow.qml`, a click-through Quickshell overlay started by
  `tools._start_pulse()` during screen reads. Quickshell ships with Omarchy;
  without it the code falls back to pulsing the focused window's border.
- **Keybinds** are read live from `omarchy menu keybindings --print` each call
  (`tools._keybinds()`), never stored. `press_keybind` sends the real chord via
  ydotool because Hyprland's `send_key_state` does NOT fire binds (verified).
  Lock/power/logout/close-all binds require `force=True`.
- **Hot reload.** `guided_tour` in `tools.py` reloads `tour.py` on every call,
  so tour edits apply without restarting the session. Edits to `live.py` or
  `tools.py` need a session restart (press the bound key twice).
- **Narration cache** is `~/.cache/beckon/narration/`, keyed by step name plus
  a hash of the text, so edited lines regenerate automatically.
- **Page text (no scrolling).** `read_page_text()` and `look_at_screen(..., mode)`
  read a window's FULL text -- including what is scrolled off screen -- from the
  AT-SPI accessibility bus, so a long email never has to be screenshotted in
  pieces. The tree walk lives at the bottom of `tools.py` behind
  `python3 tools.py --page-text`, run as a subprocess so a hung accessibility
  call cannot wedge the voice session, and `gi` is imported lazily so machines
  without python-gobject still load the tool layer. Three modes, and the system
  prompt tells the model to choose: `read_page_text()` for text, `mode="image"`
  for anything visual, default `mode="auto"` for both.
- **Which window gets read.** Hyprland's `activewindow` is the source of truth,
  matched against AT-SPI window names. AT-SPI's own ACTIVE state is unreliable
  here -- unregistered apps (Electron, terminals) leave no active window at all,
  and an earlier version happily read *some other* window instead, which would
  have the agent confidently read out a page the user isn't looking at. If the
  focused window publishes no text it returns an error saying so; it never
  substitutes a different window.
- **Enabling page text** takes two things, and BOTH are required (verified by
  testing each alone -- neither works by itself):
  ```
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface toolkit-accessibility true
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-reader-enabled true
  echo '--force-renderer-accessibility' >> ~/.config/chrome-flags.conf
  ```
  The gsettings values persist in dconf and drive `org.a11y.Status` on the
  session bus; the Chrome flag is read by Arch's `/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable`
  wrapper. Chromium apps read the accessibility state **at startup only**, so
  Chrome must be restarted after enabling, and flipping the bus properties at
  runtime does nothing for an already-running browser. Needs `at-spi2-core` and
  `python-gobject`. GTK apps expose text without the Chrome flag.
- **Machine-specific tour values** are read from `~/.config/beckon/settings.json`
  (never committed): `dev_url` is the local dev server the tour opens at the end,
  `dev_line` the narration spoken over it. Both are settable from the panel and
  fall back to generic defaults, so nothing about one user's machine belongs in
  `tour.py`.
- **Settings apply everywhere.** `live.py` reads `settings.json` for the model
  and voice when the `BECKON_LIVE_*` env vars are unset, so a choice made in the
  panel also applies when the keybind starts the session.
- **The tour restores the theme.** `tour._run` captures `omarchy theme current`
  before it starts and puts it back in `finally`, even if a step raised. It
  types into Claude only if Claude actually took focus, and never presses
  Return. If narration can't be generated it notifies once and runs silent.
- **Panel POSTs are same-origin only.** `ui.Handler._same_origin` requires
  `Content-Type: application/json`, a `Host` of `127.0.0.1:<port>` or
  `localhost:<port>`, and an `Origin` that is either absent or one of those. A
  page on any other site can otherwise fire a no-preflight `text/plain` POST at
  `/api/custom-tools` and register a shell command. Don't loosen this.
- **Tests** live in `tests/`; run `pytest` from the repo root. They cover the
  schema builder, argument coercion, the dangerous-bind matcher, private file
  writes, memory caps, settings parsing and custom-tool quoting. Nothing in
  them touches Hyprland, audio or the network. `tests/test_evals.py` guards
  the eval harness the same way (fake schema == shipped schema, sandboxed
  memory, scorer matchers, case file well-formed).
- **Evals** live in `evals/` and DO use the network -- they are not part of
  `pytest`. `evals/run.py` opens one real Live session per case in
  `evals/cases.jsonl`, swaps `tools.TOOLS` for a `FakeDesktop` (answers from
  `evals/fixtures/desktops/*.json`, records every call), sends the utterance
  as text (`--input audio` streams a TTS rendering instead), and scores with
  `evals/score.py`. `evals/compare.py A.json B.json` diffs two runs.
  `evals/vision.py` scores `find_on_screen`/`look_at_screen` prompts on local
  screenshots (never committed). Every behaviour change in `PLAN.md` is gated
  on these; record baselines in `evals/results/BASELINES.md`. Seams that exist
  only for the harness: `tools.BUILTIN_TOOLS`, `tools._parse_keybinds`,
  `tools._match_keybind`, `tools._locate`, `tools._ask_vision`,
  `live.live_config()`, and the `registry=` argument on `live.declarations`
  / `live.run_tools`. Keep them.
- **History telemetry.** Each `history.jsonl` turn carries `session`,
  `provider`, `model`, `voice`, `heard`, `reply`, `actions` (each with `tool`,
  `args`, `ms`, `ok`), `turn_ms` and `usage` (`prompt`/`response`/`total`
  tokens). The panel reads `actions` by that name -- don't rename it.
- **Pre-commit hook.** `install.sh` sets `core.hooksPath .githooks` on the
  clone it runs from; on any other clone run that `git config` by hand.

## Pitfalls already hit — don't re-learn these

- Hyprland's synthetic `BTN_LEFT` via `send_key_state` returns `ok` but no
  application receives a click. ydotool works, BUT its virtual pointer has its
  own absolute position and Hyprland delivers ydotool's clicks *there*, not at
  a cursor moved by Hyprland. So position with `ydotool mousemove --absolute`
  too. Its absolute space is a fixed multiple of Hyprland's logical coords
  (2x here); `tools._ydo_move` calibrates on first use and self-corrects.
- Live per-window props go through `hl.dsp.window.set_prop({ prop = "active_border_color",
  value = "rgba(..)" })`; `value = "-1"` clears it. `hyprctl setprop` and
  `hyprctl keyword` do not exist under the Lua config. Used for the
  screen-read border pulse.
- YouTube's `k` key *toggles* play/pause and paused videos that had already
  autoplayed. Use MPRIS: `busctl --user call org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.chromium.instanceN /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player Play` (idempotent).
- X's post editor drops characters under fast synthetic typing. Put the text
  on the clipboard with `wl-copy` and paste with Ctrl+V instead of `wtype`-ing it.
- The Gemini TTS endpoint rate-limits bursts; `narrate.generate` retries.
- The TTS endpoint also blocks bare imperatives ("set the volume to fifty
  percent") as `PROHIBITED_CONTENT` -- no `candidates` in the reply, not an
  error. Framing the text as something to be read aloud passes. It also
  sometimes mis-renders ("lock the screen" came out as "walk the screen"), so
  `evals/run.py` transcribes every generated clip with `text_model` and
  regenerates under another frame if it doesn't say the utterance
  (`.ok`/`.bad` verdicts cached next to the clip).
- Live VAD missed a 1.6 s clip streamed at 2x real time with a 1 s silent
  tail. Real-time pacing + 1.5 s tail + `audio_stream_end=True` is reliable.
- Do NOT kill Chrome's main process to restart it -- it leaves a stale
  `~/.config/google-chrome/SingletonLock` pointing at the dead PID and every
  later launch then hangs silently with no window and no error. Close the window
  (`hl.dsp.window.close()`) so Chrome exits cleanly; if it is already stuck,
  delete `SingletonLock`, `SingletonCookie` and `SingletonSocket`.
- To open a window for testing without stealing the user's screen, the classic
  rule prefix works through the Lua dispatcher:
  `hl.dsp.exec_cmd("[workspace 5 silent] uwsm-app -- <cmd>")`. It does not work
  for a second window of an already-running Chrome, which routes the request to
  the existing instance.
- If the panel serves stale code, a previous `ui.py` process is still holding
  port 8777. Kill by the PID from `ss -tlnp | grep 8777`, not by name pattern.

- `close_window` refuses to close Claude Desktop (`com.anthropic.Claude`) or
  Beckon's own panel. A user saying "close all the windows" once took out the
  chat they were driving the agent from, then couldn't get it back.

## Don't

- Don't commit `api_key`, `settings.json`, `history.jsonl`, or anything under
  `~/.config/beckon`. `.gitignore` covers the repo; be careful with copies.
- Don't paste the user's API key into a chat, a log, or a commit.
- Don't run the tour or fire test clicks while the user is actively using the
  machine — clicks land wherever the cursor actually is.
- Don't make the tour (or any tool) send posts or messages. It types; the
  user sends.
