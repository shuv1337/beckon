# Beckon

Voice control for Omarchy, powered by the Gemini Live API.

Press a key, talk normally, and your desktop does what you asked — while
you're still talking. Beckon streams audio both directions over a single
connection, so there is no record-then-wait-then-respond cycle: it answers
mid-sentence and runs actions as it hears them.

> **Independent project.** Beckon is built *for* [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org)
> users but is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or part of Omarchy, its
> maintainers, Hyprland, or Google.

## What it does

Beckon exposes your desktop to Gemini as tools it can call, and chains them
itself:

- **Windows** — focus, move, resize, swap, tile, float, fullscreen, close
- **Workspaces** — switch, send windows between them, move a workspace to another monitor
- **Typing** — type text, press keys, send shortcuts into the focused window
- **Mouse** — move the pointer, click
- **Vision** — screenshot the screen and answer questions about what's on it; a soft orange edge glow shows while it's looking
- **Reading** — pulls the *full text* of a page, email or document straight from the window, including everything scrolled off screen, so it answers without scrolling; it can use the text, the picture, or both ([setup](#reading-page-text))
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — reads your *current* Omarchy keybindings live and can trigger any of them by name (terminal, browser, screenshot, emoji picker...); rebind a key and it follows
- **Clipboard** — read and write
- **System** — volume, brightness, launch apps, open URLs
- **Your own tools** — add any shell command as a voice-callable tool from the panel
- **Memory** — remembers preferences ("email means Gmail") and short notes about
  what you're working on, so it stops asking and gets more useful over time

*"Put Chrome and my editor side by side"*, *"what does this error say?"*,
*"open the weather and read it to me"* all work as single requests.

## Where it runs

Made for **Omarchy** — built and tested on Omarchy 4.0.3.

Omarchy runs on Hyprland, and Beckon drives the desktop through Hyprland's
dispatcher API, so **other Hyprland-based setups can run it too** with a little
adjustment:

- Hyprland has to be underneath. It will not work on GNOME, KDE, X11, or
  other Wayland compositors.
- On a non-Omarchy Hyprland setup, the guided tour's theme switching (which
  uses the `omarchy` CLI) won't apply, and app launching expects `uwsm-app`
  (swap it in `beckon/tools.py` if you don't use uwsm).
- Hyprland builds without the Lua dispatcher API need the calls in
  `beckon/tools.py` adjusted to the classic `hyprctl dispatch` syntax.

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed python-websockets python-sounddevice wtype grim wl-clipboard ydotool libnotify
yay -S --needed python-google-genai
```

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Steven-Tibbs/beckon.git
cd beckon && ./install.sh
```

`install.sh` checks the dependencies above, installs to
`~/.local/share/beckon`, and puts a `beckon` launcher in `~/.local/bin`.

Then open the panel and paste your API key:

```bash
beckon ui
```

Bind a key in `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` — F8 is free on a stock Omarchy install:

```lua
o.bind("F8", "Beckon", "python3 " .. os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.local/share/beckon/live.py")
```

Press it once to start listening, again to stop.

While Beckon is speaking it closes the mic, so its own voice coming out of your
speakers can't register as you interrupting it. That means you can't talk over
it by voice; if you use headphones and want that back, start it with
`BECKON_BARGE_IN=1`.

### Installing with an AI agent

If you use Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or another coding agent, point it at
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — it has the exact steps, the checks that prove each
one worked, and the pitfalls. A prompt that works:

> Install Beckon from https://github.com/Steven-Tibbs/beckon on this Omarchy
> machine by following its AGENTS.md. Verify each step, then open `beckon ui`.

## Use

| | |
|---|---|
| `beckon` | start a live session (or press your bound key) |
| `beckon ui` | control panel: API key, voice, custom tools, history |
| *"give me a guided tour"* | the demo — it narrates itself |

The tour's last step opens a local dev server. Point it at yours from the
panel's *Voice & model* section, or put `"dev_url": "http://localhost:3000"`
(and optionally `"dev_line"` for what it says over it) in
`~/.config/beckon/settings.json`. The tour puts your theme back when it ends.

## Privacy

Audio goes to Google's Live API; that is what makes the low latency possible.
Nothing is sent anywhere else. Your key lives in `~/.config/beckon/api_key`
with `0600` permissions and is never shown in the UI, not even partially.
Conversation history is local (`~/.local/share/beckon/history.jsonl`) and has
a **clear** button in the panel.

## Memory

Beckon keeps a small memory at `~/.config/beckon/memory.json`: **preferences**
(`email → https://mail.google.com`) and **notes** about what you're working on.
It reads them at the start of every session and writes to them when you say
things like *"remember that I use Gmail"* or *"I'm working on the checkout
page."* For anything generic — email, music, notes, your editor — it uses the
saved preference, and if there isn't one it asks once and remembers the answer.

It is hard-capped at 40 preferences and 30 notes of 200 characters each, so the
file stays a few kilobytes forever; oldest entries drop off. Everything in it is
visible and deletable in the panel. It never stores secrets or email addresses.

## Reading page text

Asked *"read me this email"*, Beckon can take the whole thing from the window at
once — including the part below the fold — instead of screenshotting and
scrolling. It reads the accessibility tree the desktop already publishes, which
is faster, exact, and costs no vision call. Two settings turn it on, and both
are needed:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface toolkit-accessibility true
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-reader-enabled true
echo '--force-renderer-accessibility' >> ~/.config/chrome-flags.conf
```

Restart Chrome afterwards — Chromium reads the accessibility state only at
startup. GTK apps work without the Chrome flag. Needs `at-spi2-core` and
`python-gobject`, both in the official repos.

Without this, Beckon still sees the screen; it just sees only what's visible.
Terminals, images and video never publish text, so it falls back to looking.

## Mouse clicks

Hyprland's own synthetic clicks are accepted but never reach applications,
so `click` goes through `ydotool`. Its daemon needs `/dev/uinput`, which is
root-only by default. The simplest setup is a system service whose socket is
owned by you:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/ydotoold.service >/dev/null <<UNIT
[Unit]
Description=ydotool daemon
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ydotoold --socket-path=/tmp/.ydotool_socket --socket-own=$(id -u):$(id -g) --socket-perm=0600
Restart=on-failure
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
UNIT
sudo systemctl enable --now ydotoold
```

Everything else works without it; only `click` needs it.

## Adding your own tools

**From the panel** — *Your own tools* takes a name, a description (this is
what the assistant reads to decide when to use it), a shell command, and
optional arguments. `{arg}` placeholders are filled with shell-quoted values.
They are stored in `~/.config/beckon/custom_tools.json` and picked up when the
next session starts.

**In Python** — add a function to `beckon/tools.py` and list it in `TOOLS` at
the bottom. The docstring becomes the description, the signature becomes the
schema; nothing else to register.

```python
def lock_screen():
    """Lock the screen immediately."""
    return _hypr('hl.dsp.exec_cmd("omarchy-system-lock")')
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Fork, branch, open a PR — nothing lands on `master`
without review by the maintainer, and direct pushes are limited to the owner.

Run `pytest` from the repo root before opening one. `install.sh` enables the
pre-commit hook in `.githooks/` that refuses to commit keys or local state; on
a clone you didn't install from, run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
